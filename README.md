### Customer Records Management(CRM) is an application written in python ttkboostrap. Users can create, read, update and delete customer records. A name search function is also added so that users can directly search by either customer first name or last name. Also, a phone number format function and email validation function are also added to avoid any invalid data input. All customer data are stored in the python built-in SQLite database file.
